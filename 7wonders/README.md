# Running the code

If you have php 5.4 installed, all you need to do is:

```
php -S localhost:9000
php server.php
```

And then visit `localhost:9000` in a browser. If you're using apache, then you
don't need the `php -S` command, just be sure to point apache at the root of the
repository.
